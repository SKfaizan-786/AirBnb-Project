## üè† Airbnb Clone

This project is a full-stack **Airbnb clone** built to showcase a platform where users can  
browse and manage property listings, using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**,  
**EJS**, and **Bootstrap**.

It allows users to **register, log in, and manage listings** with full CRUD functionality.  
Each listing includes a title, description, image, price, and location, with  
**Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap** for live map views.

**User authentication** is implemented with **Passport.js**, and Bootstrap handles responsive  
design and validation.

Easily deployable and tested on **Railway**, this project demonstrates real-world concepts  
like routing, authentication, external API integration, and dynamic UI rendering in a modern web application.
